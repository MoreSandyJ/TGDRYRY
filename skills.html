	<h3>I have mostly skills with using different websites but I do like constructing things.</h3>
	<h3>At my house I'm known as Junior Tech Support as I'm the one who handles the technical issues in my house. So if the television is on another output and it isn't showing up, I'm normally the one checking if cables are tight enough.</h3>
	<h3>I also like creating thing. My more creative skills would be writing, art, creating devices (such as a fan I made with a plastic food container and a DC Motor)
	and building things like the cat houses I build for my dad's kittens or my Halloween costume constructed with a Home Dept. Box!</h3>
