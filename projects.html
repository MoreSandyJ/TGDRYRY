<h3>These characters are from my upcoming book series, "Shadows for Redemption".
 It follows sixteen-year-old, Valorie Wind and her now, ghost twin brother, Daniel Wind 
 and their quest to let Spectors "RIP" in a world which has removed the ability for them to do so.</h3>
 <h3>Valorie, a medium, wants the town of Lakerton to accept Spectors like once in the past, but with the 
 exploitation of the ghastly figures from a group of mortals known as Hunters, it seems the twins
 have their work cut out for them!</h3>
 <h3>Valorie and Daniel will meet folk like Novalie, a secluded classmate of Valorie, who seems to share a similar goal as our main duo.
 Anastasios, a feathered-guide of sorts to help the crew learn about the dark past of Lakerton.
 And of course Daniel's (somehow...) girlfriend, Madison and her best friend Lydia who seemingly exist to make Valorie's like a waking nightmare.</h3>
 <h3>With their success in helping Spectors move on to the afterlife in a process known as "RIPing",
 she'll discover what happened to those who've walked in the path of the Hunters; A path she unknowingly
 stepped straight into...</h3>
